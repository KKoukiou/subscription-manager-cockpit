# git blame ignore list
#
# This file contains git hashes of commits to be ignored by git blame.
# These commits are considered not important (in means of "they don't
# change any code logic/abstract syntax tree").
#
# - Only large global changes should be added to this list.
# - Add comment above every commit hash, preferably with timestamp,
#   author and commit title.
# - Append new hashes to the bottom; keep the list chronological.
